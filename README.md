This project is a Travel Planner Bot built using Streamlit and Groq LLM, designed to create quick, clear, and budget-friendly travel itineraries for any location. The app allows users to enter a place, budget, and trip duration, and the AI instantly generates a neat, professional bullet-point travel plan. The interface is simple, colourful, and user-friendly, making it easy for students and travelers to use. The project includes a Python Streamlit app, LLM integration, and a clean UI layout, making it suitable for portfolio, academic projects, and demonstrations. It also shows how to deploy an AI model in a practical web application with proper structure, Git version control, and comments for easy understanding.
